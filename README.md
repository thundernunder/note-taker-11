<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Challenge 11 involves creating a simple note-taking application for web. Completing this challenge allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of html, css, Javascript (including Node, Express, and UUID).</p> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install Node packages Express and UUID.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>
<p>Fist, install all node packages by entering 'npm i' into the command line. Once installations are complete, type 'npm start' into the command line. You'll know application is ready to use once you see 'Server available at localhost3001'.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<h2>Test</h2>
<p>No tests were required for this project. That doesn't mean it's a bad idea to include for future, however!</p>
